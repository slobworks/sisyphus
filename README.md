DISCLAIMER: I have not had a chance to test this out myself. Feel free to edit it as you see fit.

Sisyphus is my take on an ESS Solo-1 (ES1938S) based PCI audio card. It's based on the reference schematics for the ES1938S, but with a few added goodies (such as a quad amp on the output) and a few rather useless things removed (such as microphone input).

Made in KiCAD 8.0something.
Also includes gerber files so you can try it out for yourself.
