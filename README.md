DISCLAIMER: I have not had a chance to test this out myself. I don't have any idea how or where to get an I/O bracket that would fit this consequently; I tried to make it match the one used by an ISA SB16 sound card I had on hand, but it probably is incorrect. Feel free to edit it as you see fit, in fact you have my blessing to do so.

This is the low cost (LC) variant of Sisyphus. The board is close to 1/2 the size, the headphone amp + slider and all but one 3.5" jack (the Line Output) has been removed. It still has internal Line In through a 4-pin, CD-ROM cable header, to allow for daisy-chaining sound cards within the computer.

Made in KiCAD 8.0something.
Also includes gerber files so you can try it out for yourself.
