DISCLAIMER: I have not had a chance to test this out myself. I don't have any idea how or where to get an I/O bracket that would fit this consequently; I tried to make it match the one used by an ISA SB16 sound card I had on hand, but it probably is incorrect. Feel free to edit it as you see fit, in fact you have my blessing to do so.

Sisyphus is my take on an ESS Solo-1 (ES1938S) based PCI audio card. It's based on the reference schematics for the ES1938S, but with a few added goodies (such as a quad amp on the output and a volume control for the headphone output) and a few rather useless things removed (such as microphone input).

Made in KiCAD 8.0something.
Also includes gerber files so you can try it out for yourself.
